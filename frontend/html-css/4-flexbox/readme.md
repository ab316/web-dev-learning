# FlexBox
A CSS layout mode that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.

FlexBox is an alternative to the box model in CSS where we assign widths and use floats to arrange items on a page. It requires factoring margins and paddings into the calculation. FlexBox takes care of all of this.

## Features
- No floats
- Responsive and mobile friendly
- Makes it easy to position child elments
- Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margin of its contents
- Order of elements can be easily changed without editing the HTML

## Concept
- Ability to alter item width and height to best fit in its container's available free space
- Direction-agnostic. In the normal box-model. Block elements are vertically biased and inline elements are horizontally biased. FlexBox works for both the same.
- Built for small-scale layouts (the Grid specification is for more large scale)
